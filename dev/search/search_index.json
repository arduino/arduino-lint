Its focus is on the structure, metadata, and configuration of Arduino projects, rather than the code. Rules cover specification compliance, Library Manager submission requirements, and best practices. Installation \u00b6 See the installation instructions . Getting started \u00b6 Once installed, you only need to open a terminal at your project folder and run the command: arduino-lint This will automatically detect the project type and check it against the relevant rules. The default configuration of Arduino Lint provides for the most common use case, but you have the option of changing settings via command line flags : Compliance setting \u00b6 The --compliance flag allows you to configure the strictness of the applied rules. The three compliance level values accepted by this flag are: permissive - failure will occur only when severe rule violations are found. Although a project that passes at the permissive setting will work with the current Arduino development software versions, it may not be fully specification-compliant, risking incompatibility or a poor experience for the users. specification - the default setting, enforces compliance with the official Arduino project specifications ( sketch , library , platform ). strict - enforces best practices, above and beyond the minimum requirements for specification compliance. Use this setting to ensure the best experience for the users of the project. Library Manager setting \u00b6 Arduino Library Manager is the best way to provide installation and updates of Arduino libraries. In order to be accepted for inclusion in Library Manager, a library is required to meet some requirements . Arduino Lint provides checks for these requirements as well, controlled by the --library-manager flag. The Library Manager submission-specific rules are enabled via --library-manager submit . Even if your library isn't yet ready to be added to Library Manager, it's a good idea to use this setting to ensure no incompatibilities are introduced. Once your library is in the Library Manager index, each release is automatically picked up and made available to the Arduino community. Releases are also subject to special rules. The command arduino-lint --library-manager update will tell you whether your library is compliant with these rules. Integration \u00b6 The --format flag configures the format of arduino-lint 's output. The default --format text setting provides human readable output. For automation or integration with other tools, the machine readable output provided by --format json may be more convenient. This setting exposes every detail of the rules that were applied. The --report-file flag causes arduino-lint to write the JSON output to the specified file. Environment variables \u00b6 Additional configuration options intended for internal use or development can be set via environment variables: ARDUINO_LINT_OFFICIAL - Set to \"true\" to run the checks that only apply to official Arduino projects. ARDUINO_LINT_LIBRARY_MANAGER_INDEXING - Set to \"true\" to run the checks that apply when adding releases to the Library Manager index. ARDUINO_LINT_LOG_LEVEL - Messages with this level and above will be logged. Supported values: trace , debug , info , warn , error , fatal , panic ARDUINO_LINT_LOG_FORMAT - The output format for the logs. Supported values: text , json Continuous integration \u00b6 Arduino Lint would be a great addition to your continuous integration system. Running the tool after each change to the project can allow you to identify any problems that were introduced. This is easily done by using the arduino/arduino-lint-action GitHub Actions action: https://github.com/arduino/arduino-lint-action Add a simple workflow file to the repository of your Arduino project and GitHub will automatically run Arduino Lint on every pull request and push.

This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository. There are several ways you can get involved: Type of contribution Contribution method - Support request - Question - Discussion Post on the Arduino Forum - Bug report - Feature request Issue report (read the issue guidelines ) Beta testing Try out the nightly build - Bug fix - Enhancement Pull Request (read the pull request guidelines ) Monetary - Donate - Buy official products Issue Reports \u00b6 Do you need help or have a question about using Arduino Lint? Support requests should be made to the Arduino forum . High quality bug reports and feature requests are valuable contributions to the Arduino Lint project. Before reporting an issue \u00b6 Give the nightly build a test drive to see if your issue was already resolved. Search existing pull requests and issues to see if it was already reported. If you have additional information to provide about an existing issue, please comment there. You can use GitHub's \"Reactions\" feature if you only want to express support. Qualities of an excellent report \u00b6 The issue title should be descriptive. Vague titles make it difficult to understand the purpose of the issue, which might cause your issue to be overlooked. Provide a full set of steps necessary to reproduce the issue. Demonstration code or commands should be complete and simplified to the minimum necessary to reproduce the issue. Be responsive. We may need you to provide additional information in order to investigate and resolve the issue. If you find a solution to your problem, please comment on your issue report with an explanation of how you were able to fix it and close the issue. Pull Requests \u00b6 To propose improvements or fix a bug, feel free to submit a PR. Pull request checklist \u00b6 In order to ease code reviews and have your contributions merged faster, here is a list of items you can check before submitting a PR: Create small PRs that are narrowly focused on addressing a single concern. Write tests for the code you wrote. Maintain clean commit history and use meaningful commit messages . PRs with messy commit history are difficult to review and require a lot of work to be merged. If the PR contains a breaking change, please start the commit message and PR title with the string [breaking] . Don't forget to describe in the PR description what changes users might need to make in their workflow or application due to this PR. A breaking change is a change that forces users to change their command-line invocations or parsing of the JSON formatted output when upgrading from an older version of Arduino Lint. PR titles indirectly become part of the CHANGELOG so it's crucial to provide a good record of what change is being made in the title; why it was made will go in the PR description, along with a link to a GitHub issue if one exists. Open your PR against the main branch. Your PR must pass all CI tests before we will merge it. You can run the CI in your fork by clicking the \"Actions\" tab and then the \"I understand my workflows...\" button. If you're seeing an error and don't think it's your fault, it may not be! The reviewer will help you if there are test failures that seem not related to the change you are making. Development prerequisites \u00b6 To build Arduino Lint from sources you need the following tools to be available in your local environment: Go version 1.16 or later Taskfile to help you run the most common tasks from the command line If you want to run integration tests or work on documentation, you will also need: A working Python environment, version 3.9 or later. Poetry . Building the source code \u00b6 From the project folder root, just run: F task build The project uses Go modules, so dependencies will be downloaded automatically. At the end of the build, you should find the arduino-lint executable in the same folder. Running the checks \u00b6 There are several checks and test suites in place to ensure the code works as expected and is written in a way that's consistent across the whole codebase. To avoid pushing changes that will cause the CI system to fail, you can run the checks locally by running this command: task check Go unit tests \u00b6 To run only the Go unit tests, run: task go:test By default, all tests for all Arduino Lint's Go packages are run. To run unit tests for only one or more specific packages, you can set the TARGETS environment variable, e.g.: TARGETS=./internal/rule task go:test Alternatively, to run only some specific test(s), you can specify a regex to match against the test function name, e.g.: TEST_REGEX='^TestLibraryProperties.*' task go:test Both can be combined as well, typically to run only a specific test: TEST_REGEX='^TestFindProjects$' TARGETS=./internal/project task go:test Integration tests \u00b6 Being a command line interface, Arduino Lint is heavily interactive and it has to stay consistent in accepting the user input and providing the expected output and proper exit codes. For these reasons, in addition to regular unit tests the project has a suite of integration tests that actually run arduino-lint in a different process and assess the options are correctly understood and the output is what we expect. Running tests After the software requirements have been installed, you should be able to run the tests with: task go:test-integration This will automatically install the necessary dependencies, if not already installed, and run the integration tests automatically. To run specific tests, you must run pytest from the virtual environment created by Poetry. poetry run pytest tests/test_all.py::test_report_file You can avoid writing the poetry run prefix each time by creating a new shell inside the virtual environment: poetry shell pytest test_lib.py pytest test_lib.py::test_list Automated corrections \u00b6 Tools are provided to automatically bring the project into compliance with some required checks. Run them all with this command: task fix Working on documentation \u00b6 Documentation is provided to final users in form of static HTML content generated from a tool called MkDocs and hosted on GitHub Pages : https://arduino.github.io/arduino-lint/dev/ Local development \u00b6 The documentation consists of static content written over several Markdown files under the docs subfolder of the Arduino Lint repository, as well as the dynamically generated command line reference . When working on the documentation, it is useful to be able to see the effect the changes will have on the generated documentation website. You can build the documentation website and serve it from your personal computer by running the command: task website:serve The documentation will build. If you don't see any error, open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser to local the local copy of the documentation. Documentation publishing \u00b6 The Arduino Lint git repository has a special branch called gh-pages that contains the generated HTML code for the documentation website. Every time a change is pushed to this special branch, GitHub automatically triggers a deployment to pull the change and publish a new version of the website. Do not open Pull Requests to push changes to the gh-pages branch; that will be done exclusively from the CI.
